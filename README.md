# Space Invaders by TDD method.
### Authors : Kalvin N. & Yannis P. - IUT du Limousin, DÃ©partement Informatique

This is the Space Invaders by TDD project (not anymore), originally for the OOC course (Object Oriented Conception).
The work was initially divided in parts called sprints.

### Goal 1 : A minimalist Space Invaders (*goal reached*)
* Sprint 0 : Implementation of the technical environment & quick analysis.
* Sprint 1 : Move the ship in the play area
* Sprint 2 : Sizing the ship
* Spike : Implementation of a graphic engine 
* Sprint 3 : Choose the speed of the ship
* Sprint 4 : Firing a missile from the ship
* Sprint 5 : Add an invader in the game
* Sprint 6 : Detect a collision between 2 sprites
* Sprint 7 : End the game

### Goal 2 : Classical Space Invaders (*not yet reached*)

Sprint 8 to 12 - To Be Added.

### Goal 3 : Adding optional features (*not yet reached*)

Sprint 13 to TBD - To Be Added.

### Notes 

* The code is in **French**. It is a project resulting from a French University (*IUT du Limousin, Limoges*)
* Since the course is over (goal 1 reached), the project is no longer developed with the TDD method.
